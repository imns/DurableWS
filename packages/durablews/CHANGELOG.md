# durablews

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cd77029: Add `dedup` to `durablews/middleware`: inbound middleware that drops duplicate messages (by a `key` you extract), so a server that redelivers never reaches your handler twice. Memory is bounded by `window` (drop-oldest), like the core send queue. Tree-shakable, like the rest of the pack.
- f1a9359: Add `logger` to `durablews/middleware`: structured logging of every message in both directions, with a `redact` hook that scrubs secrets/PII for the logs only (the wire and your handlers see the real message). Tree-shakable, like the rest of the pack.
- c4583c4: Add `durablews/middleware`, a tree-shakable pack of built-in middleware (RFC 0002), starting with `auth`. Import only what you use; unused middleware add zero bundle bytes.

  `auth({ token, inject })` is outbound middleware that resolves a credential at transmission time and injects it into each message, so a message queued across a reconnect still goes out with a fresh token.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 6acd50b: README: drop the alpha banner and `@alpha` install instructions, 2.0.0 is the latest release. No code changes; this publish exists so the npm page stops showing alpha framing.

## 2.0.0

### Minor Changes

- dd4dfbd: durablews 2.0.0, stable.

  Everything from the alpha line, graduated: automatic reconnection
  (full-jitter exponential backoff, `shouldReconnect` veto), bounded message
  queueing with observable drops, opt-in heartbeat (close code 4408),
  typed + Standard-Schema-validated messages, middleware in both directions
  (transmission-time, ordered async), a pluggable codec, Vue and React
  bindings (`durablews/vue`, `durablews/react`), and a drop-in `WebSocket`
  class (`durablews/compat`), zero runtime dependencies, core ≤ 3 KB brotli
  (CI-enforced), tested in browsers (Playwright), Node 22, Deno 2, and Bun.

- d68f047: First public v2 alpha. A ground-up rewrite of the client around an explicit
  connection state machine, durable by default, zero dependencies, built on the
  standard global `WebSocket` (browsers, Node ≥ 22, Deno, Bun, edge).

  - **Automatic reconnection, on by default**: full-jitter exponential backoff,
    unlimited retries, `shouldReconnect` veto, `reconnecting` events.
  - **Message queueing while disconnected, on by default**: bounded,
    drop-oldest, flushed in order on open; every dropped message fires a `drop`
    event.
  - **Opt-in heartbeat / idle detection**: dead links are closed (code `4408`)
    and recovered through the normal reconnect machinery.
  - **Typed + validated messages**: pass any Standard Schema (zod, valibot,
    arktype, …) and message types are inferred and runtime-validated; or use
    plain generics.
  - **Middleware, inbound and outbound**: `use()` onion pipeline; outbound runs
    at transmission time, async-capable with strict send-order preservation
    (auth/token-refresh ready).
  - **Framework bindings in the box**: `durablews/vue` (composable) and
    `durablews/react` (hook via `useSyncExternalStore`), with the frameworks as
    optional peers.
  - **Pluggable codec**: JSON by default, swap in anything.
  - Promise-based `connect()`, standard event vocabulary (`open` / `message` /
    `close` / `error` / `statechange`), observable state snapshots with
    `subscribe()` / `getState()`.

  Breaking: the v1 store API (`defineStore`, `dispatch`, actions/reducers) is
  removed; `defineClient` no longer returns a shared singleton.
